# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Express.js Asynchronous Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: unhandled promise rejections in asynchronous route handlers.  When an asynchronous operation within a route handler throws an error, and that error isn't properly caught and handled, it can lead to unexpected behavior or even crashes.  This example shows how to fix this using proper error handling.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code.  The `/` route handler performs an asynchronous operation (`someAsyncOperation`) that might fail. If it fails, the error is logged to the console, but **no response is sent back to the client**. This leaves the client hanging indefinitely.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file shows the corrected code.  The `catch` block now includes a proper response to the client, informing them of the error. This ensures that the client doesn't hang and receives appropriate feedback.

## How to reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `bug` directory.
3. Run `node bug.js`.
4. Send a request to `http://localhost:3000`. Repeat several times to see inconsistent behaviour.
5. Repeat the steps with `bugSolution.js` and observe the consistent and proper behaviour.

## Key improvements
* **Complete Error Handling:** The solution includes a `catch` block that always sends a response to the client, regardless of success or failure.
* **Informative Error Response:** The response in case of error provides useful information to the client.
* **Robustness:** The improved code is more robust and prevents unexpected behavior.
